  summary: Python sync/async framework for Interactive Brokers API
  description: |
    The goal of the IB-insync library is to make working with the Trader Workstation API from Interactive Brokers as easy as possible.
    The main features are
    * An easy to use linear style of programming;
    * An IB component that automatically keeps in sync with the TWS or IB Gateway application;
    * A fully asynchonous framework based on asyncio and eventkit for advanced users;
    * Interactive operation with live data in Jupyter notebooks.
